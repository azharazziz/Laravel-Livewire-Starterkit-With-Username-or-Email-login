# Laravel Livewire Starterkit With Username or Email login

### Laravel Livewire Starterkit

Laravel + [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Livewire frontend.

Livewire is a powerful way of building dynamic, reactive, frontend UIs using just PHP. It's a great fit for teams that primarily use Blade templates and are looking for a simpler alternative to JavaScript-driven SPA frameworks like React and Vue.

This Livewire starter kit utilizes Livewire 3, Laravel Volt, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [Flux UI](https://fluxui.dev) component library.

### What We Do?

This project is built upon the Laravel 12 Livewire Starter Kit serving as a foundational framework for rapid web application development. It extends the core functionalities of the starter kit by introducing a flexible authentication system that allows users to log in using either their username or email. This enhancement improves user accessibility and convenience making authentication more user-friendly while maintaining security. The project retains the powerful features of Livewire for seamless dynamic UI updates without requiring full page reloads ensuring a modern and efficient user experience.</p>
